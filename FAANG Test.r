# SOME OTHERS EXAMPLES OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS (from leetcode, solution in R)
#Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and - (leetcode - Medium)

# Find the Duplicate Number (leetcode - Medium)

# Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays (leetcode - Hard)
